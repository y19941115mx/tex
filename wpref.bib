abstract = {Recommendation algorithms are best known for their use on e-commerce Web sites, where they use input about a customer's interests to generate a list of recommended items. Many applications use only the items that customers purchase and explicitly rate to represent their interests, but they can also use other attributes, including items viewed, demographic data, subject interests, and favorite artists. At Amazon.com, we use recommendation algorithms to personalize the online store for each customer. The store radically changes based on customer interests, showing programming titles to a software engineer and baby toys to a new mother. There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods. Here, we compare these methods with our algorithm, which we call item-to-item collaborative filtering. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering, our algorithm's online computation scales independently of the number of customers and number of items in the product catalog. Our algorithm produces recommendations in real-time, scales to massive data sets, and generates high quality recommendations.},

abstract = {In this paper, based on the user-tag-object tripartite graphs, we propose a recommendation algorithm, which considers social tags as an important role for information retrieval. Besides its low cost of computational time, the experiment results of two real-world data sets, $\backslash$emph{\{}Del.icio.us{\}} and $\backslash$emph{\{}MovieLens{\}}, show it can enhance the algorithmic accuracy and diversity. Especially, it can obtain more personalized recommendation results when users have diverse topics of tags. In addition, the numerical results on the dependence of algorithmic accuracy indicates that the proposed algorithm is particularly effective for small degree objects, which reminds us of the well-known $\backslash$emph{\{}cold-start{\}} problem in recommender systems. Further empirical study shows that the proposed algorithm can significantly solve this problem in social tagging systems with heterogeneous object degree distributions.},

abstract = {This work develops a representation learning method for bipartite networks. While existing works have developed various embedding methods for network data, they have primarily focused on homo-geneous networks in general and overlooked the special properties of bipartite networks. As such, these methods can be suboptimal for embedding bipartite networks. In this paper, we propose a new method named BiNE, short for Bipartite Network Embedding, to learn the vertex representations for bipartite networks. By performing biased random walks pur-posefully, we generate vertex sequences that can well preserve the long-tail distribution of vertices in the original bipartite network. We then propose a novel optimization framework by accounting for both the explicit relations (i.e., observed links) and implicit relations (i.e., unobserved but transitive links) in learning the ver-tex representations. We conduct extensive experiments on several real datasets covering the tasks of link prediction (classification), recommendation (personalized ranking), and visualization. Both quantitative results and qualitative analysis verify the effectiveness and rationality of our BiNE method.},

abstract = {Recently, network based recommendation algorithms have demonstrated much better performance than the standard collaborative filtering method, and most of which have been focused on the unweighted cases even in a multigraded rating system. However, these modifications from multigraded rating data to binary data may lose information, thus hinder the expressing of user's preference and finally misleading the recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose to use weighted bipartite user-object networks to model the recommender systems. The weight of the edge is directly the rate that a user giving on an object. We use a benchmark dataset, i.e., Moivelens dataset, to test the performance. The results show that weighted theme has higher recommendation accuracy than its unweighted counterpart.},
