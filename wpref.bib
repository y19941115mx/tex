abstract = {Prediction tasks over nodes and edges in networks require careful effort in engineering features used by learning algorithms. Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the fea- tures themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learn- ing continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of- the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken to- gether, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state- of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

abstract = {We present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide {\$}F{\_}1{\$} scores up to 10{\%} higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60{\%} less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose an incremental item-based collaborative filtering algorithm. It works with binary ratings (sometimes also called implicit ratings), as it is typically the case in a Web environment. Our method is capable of incorporating new information in parallel with performing recommendation. New sessions and new users are used to update the similarity matrix as they appear. The proposed algorithm is compared with a non-incremental one, as well as with an incremental user-based approach, based on an existing explicit rating recommender. The use of techniques for working with sparse matrices on these algorithms is also evaluated. All versions, implemented in R, are evaluated on 5 datasets with various number of users and/or items. We observed that: Recall tends to improve when we continuously add information to the recommender model; the time spent for recommendation does not degrade; the time for updating the similarity matrix (necessary to the recommendation) is relatively low and motivates the use of the item-based incremental approach. Moreover we study how the number of items and users affects the user based and the item based approaches. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Most existing graph embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method called the "LINE," which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine. The source code of the LINE is available online. 1},

Without using metadata, our method outperforms the best reported results on PubMed and DBLP datasets with relative improvements of over 18{\%} in F1@20 and over 22{\%} in MRR. We show empirically that, although adding metadata improves the performance on standard metrics, it favors self-citations which are less useful in a citation recommendation setup.

abstract = {In recommender systems, collaborative filtering technology is an important method to evaluate user preference through exploiting user feedback data, and has been widely used in industrial areas. Diffusion-based recommendation algorithms inspired by diffusion phenomenon in physical dynamics are a crucial branch of collaborative filtering technology, which use a bipartite network to represent collection behaviors between users and items. However, diffusion-based recommendation algorithms calculate the similarity between users and make recommendations by only considering implicit feedback but neglecting the benefits from explicit feedback data, which would be a significant feature in recommender systems. This paper proposes a mixed similarity diffusion model to integrate both explicit feedback and implicit feedback. First, cosine similarity between users is calculated by explicit feedback, and we integrate it with resource-allocation index calculated by implicit feedback. We further improve the performance of the mixed similarity diffusion model by considering the degrees of users and items at the same time in diffusion processes. Some sophisticated experiments are designed to evaluate our proposed method on three real-world data sets. Experimental results indicate that recommendations given by the mixed similarity diffusion perform better on both the accuracy and the diversity than that of most state-of-the-art algorithms.},

There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods.

abstract = {Top-N item recommendation techniques, e.g., pairwise models, learn the rank of users' preferred items through separating items into positive samples if user-item interactions exist, and negative samples otherwise. This separation results in an important issue: the extreme imbalance between positive and negative samples, because the number of items with user actions is much less than those without actions. The problem is even worse for "cold-start" users. In addition, existing learning models only consider the observed user-item proximity, while neglecting other useful relations, such as the unobserved but potentially helpful user-item relations, and high-order proximity in user-user, item-item relations. In this paper, we aim at incorporating multiple types of user-item relations into a unified pairwise ranking model towards approximately optimizing ranking metrics mean average precision (MAP), and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Instead of taking statical separation of positive and negative sets, we employ a random walk approach to dynamically draw positive samples from short random walk sequences, and a rank-aware negative sampling method to draw negative samples for efficiently learning the proposed pairwise ranking model. The proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art baselines on two large and sparse datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the other baselines with average 4{\%} at different top-N metrics, in particular for cold-start users with 6{\%} on average.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an evolution model and an analysis of the behavior of music consumers on online music streaming services. While previous studies have observed power-law degree distributions of usage in online music streaming services, the underlying behavior of users has not been well understood. Users and songs can be described using a bipartite network where an edge exists between a user node and a song node when the user has listened that song. The growth mechanism of bipartite networks has been used to understand the evolution of online bipartite networks Zhang et al. (2013). Existing bipartite models are based on a preferential attachment mechanism L{\'{a}}szl{\'{o}} Barab{\'{a}}si and Albert (1999) in which the probability that a user listens to a song is proportional to its current popularity. This mechanism does not allow for two types of real world phenomena. First, a newly released song with high quality sometimes quickly gains popularity. Second, the popularity of songs normally decreases as time goes by. Therefore, this paper proposes a new model that is more suitable for online music services by adding fitness and aging functions to the song nodes of the bipartite network proposed by Zhang et al. (2013). Theoretical analyses are performed for the degree distribution of songs. Empirical data from an online streaming service, Last.fm, are used to confirm the degree distribution of the object nodes. Simulation results show improvements from a previous model. Finally, to illustrate the application of the proposed model, a simplified royalty cost model for online music services is used to demonstrate how the changes in the proposed parameters can affect the costs for online music streaming providers. Managerial implications are also discussed.},

abstract = {The bipartite graph is a ubiquitous data structure that can model the relationship between two entity types: for instance, users and items, queries and webpages. In this paper, we study the problem of ranking vertices of a bipartite graph, based on the graph's link structure as well as prior information about vertices (which we term a query vector). We present a new solution, BiRank, which iteratively assigns scores to vertices and finally converges to a unique stationary ranking. In contrast to the traditional random walk-based methods, BiRank iterates towards optimizing a regularization function, which smooths the graph under the guidance of the query vector. Importantly, we establish how BiRank relates to the Bayesian methodology, enabling the future extension in a probabilistic way. To show the rationale and extendability of the ranking methodology, we further extend it to rank for the more generic n-partite graphs. BiRank's generic modeling of both the graph structure and vertex features enables it to model various ranking hypotheses flexibly. To illustrate its functionality, we apply the BiRank and TriRank (ranking for tripartite graphs) algorithms to two real-world applications: a general ranking scenario that predicts the future popularity of items, and a personalized ranking scenario that recommends items of interest to users. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate BiRank's soundness (fast convergence), efficiency (linear in the number of graph edges) and effectiveness (achieving state-of-the-art in the two real-world tasks).},

When it comes to model the key factor in collaborative filtering -- the interaction between user and item features, they still resorted to matrix factorization and applied an inner product on the latent features of users and items. By replacing the inner product with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary function from data, we present a general framework named NCF, short for Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering. NCF is generic and can express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. To supercharge NCF modelling with non-linearities, we propose to leverage a multi-layer perceptron to learn the user-item interaction function. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show significant improvements of our proposed NCF framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Empirical evidence shows that using deeper layers of neural networks offers better recommendation performance.},

abstract = {Embedding network data into a low-dimensional vector space has shown promising performance for many real-world applications, such as node classification and entity retrieval. However, most existing methods focused only on leveraging network structure. For social networks, besides the network structure, there also exists rich information about social actors, such as user profiles of friendship networks and textual content of citation networks. These rich attribute information of social actors reveal the homophily effect, exerting huge impacts on the formation of social networks. In this paper, we explore the rich evidence source of attributes in social networks to improve network embedding. We propose a generic Social Network Embedding framework (SNE), which learns representations for social actors (i.e., nodes) by preserving both the structural proximity and attribute proximity. While the structural proximity captures the global network structure, the attribute proximity accounts for the homophily effect. To justify our proposal, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world social networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art network embedding approaches, SNE can learn more informative representations, achieving substantial gains on the tasks of link prediction and node classification. Specifically, SNE significantly outperforms node2vec with an 8.2{\%} relative improvement on the link prediction task, and a 12.7{\%} gain on the node classification task.},

abstract = {Many existing approaches to collaborative filtering can neither handle very large datasets nor easily deal with users who have very few ratings. In this paper we present the ProbabilisticMatrix Factorization (PMF) model which scales linearly with the number of observations and, more importantly, performs well on the large, sparse, and very imbalanced Netflix dataset. We further extend the PMF model to include an adaptive prior on the model parameters and show how the model capacity can be controlled automatically. Finally, we introduce a con- strained version of the PMF model that is based on the assumption that users who have rated similar sets ofmovies are likely to have similar preferences. The result- ingmodel is able to generalize considerably better for userswith very few ratings. When the predictions of multiple PMF models are linearly combined with the predictions of Restricted Boltzmann Machines models, we achieve an error rate of 0.8861, that is nearly 7{\%} better than the score of Netflix's own system. 1},

In this paper the recommender system PRES is described that uses content-based filtering techniques to suggest small articles about home improvements. A domain such as this implicates that the user model has to be very dynamic and learned from positive feedback only. The relevance feedback method seems to be a good candidate for learning such a user model, as it is both efficient and dynamic.},

abstract = {This work develops a representation learning method for bipartite networks. While existing works have developed various embedding methods for network data, they have primarily focused on homo-geneous networks in general and overlooked the special properties of bipartite networks. As such, these methods can be suboptimal for embedding bipartite networks. In this paper, we propose a new method named BiNE, short for Bipartite Network Embedding, to learn the vertex representations for bipartite networks. By performing biased random walks pur-posefully, we generate vertex sequences that can well preserve the long-tail distribution of vertices in the original bipartite network. We then propose a novel optimization framework by accounting for both the explicit relations (i.e., observed links) and implicit relations (i.e., unobserved but transitive links) in learning the ver-tex representations. We conduct extensive experiments on several real datasets covering the tasks of link prediction (classification), recommendation (personalized ranking), and visualization. Both quantitative results and qualitative analysis verify the effectiveness and rationality of our BiNE method.},

@article{Wu2017,
abstract = {Both reviews and user-item interactions (i.e., rating scores) have been widely adopted for user rating prediction. However, these existing techniques mainly extract the latent representations for users and items in an independent and static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is derived to encode her preference without considering the particular characteristics of each candidate item. We argue that this static encoding scheme is difficult to fully capture the users' preference. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware user-item representation learning model for rating prediction, named CARL. Namely, CARL derives a joint representation for a given user-item pair based on their individual latent features and latent feature interactions. Then, CARL adopts Factorization Machines to further model higher-order feature interactions on the basis of the user-item pair for rating prediction. Specifically, two separate learning components are devised in CARL to exploit review data and interaction data respectively: review-based feature learning and interaction-based feature learning. In review-based learning component, with convolution operations and attention mechanism, the relevant features for a user-item pair are extracted by jointly considering their corresponding reviews. However, these features are only review-driven and may not be comprehensive. Hence, interaction-based learning component further extracts complementary features from interaction data alone, also on the basis of user-item pairs. The final rating score is then derived with a dynamic linear fusion mechanism. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that CARL achieves significantly better rating prediction accuracy than existing state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with attention mechanism, we show that the relevant information in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the rating prediction.},
