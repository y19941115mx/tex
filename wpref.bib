abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

In this paper, we first introduce CF tasks and their main challenges, such as data sparsity, scalability, synonymy, gray sheep, shilling attacks, privacy protection, etc., and their possible solutions. We then present three main categories of CF techniques: memory-based, model-based, and hybrid CF algorithms (that combine CF with other recommendation techniques), with examples for representative algorithms of each category, and analysis of their predictive performance and their ability to address the challenges. From basic techniques to the state-of-the-art, we attempt to present a comprehensive survey for CF techniques, which can be served as a roadmap for research and practice in this area.},

abstract = {Recommendation algorithms are best known for their use on e-commerce Web sites, where they use input about a customer's interests to generate a list of recommended items. Many applications use only the items that customers purchase and explicitly rate to represent their interests, but they can also use other attributes, including items viewed, demographic data, subject interests, and favorite artists. At Amazon.com, we use recommendation algorithms to personalize the online store for each customer. The store radically changes based on customer interests, showing programming titles to a software engineer and baby toys to a new mother. There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods. Here, we compare these methods with our algorithm, which we call item-to-item collaborative filtering. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering, our algorithm's online computation scales independently of the number of customers and number of items in the product catalog. Our algorithm produces recommendations in real-time, scales to massive data sets, and generates high quality recommendations.},

Explanations provide many benefits, from improving user satisfaction to helping users make better decisions. This paper introduces tagsplanations, which are explanations based on community tags. Tagsplanations have two key components: tag relevance, the degree to which a tag describes an item, and tag preference, the user's sentiment toward a tag.

abstract = {This paper proposes an evolution model and an analysis of the behavior of music consumers on online music streaming services. While previous studies have observed power-law degree distributions of usage in online music streaming services, the underlying behavior of users has not been well understood. Users and songs can be described using a bipartite network where an edge exists between a user node and a song node when the user has listened that song. The growth mechanism of bipartite networks has been used to understand the evolution of online bipartite networks Zhang et al. (2013). Existing bipartite models are based on a preferential attachment mechanism L{\'{a}}szl{\'{o}} Barab{\'{a}}si and Albert (1999) in which the probability that a user listens to a song is proportional to its current popularity. This mechanism does not allow for two types of real world phenomena. First, a newly released song with high quality sometimes quickly gains popularity. Second, the popularity of songs normally decreases as time goes by. Therefore, this paper proposes a new model that is more suitable for online music services by adding fitness and aging functions to the song nodes of the bipartite network proposed by Zhang et al. (2013). Theoretical analyses are performed for the degree distribution of songs. Empirical data from an online streaming service, Last.fm, are used to confirm the degree distribution of the object nodes. Simulation results show improvements from a previous model. Finally, to illustrate the application of the proposed model, a simplified royalty cost model for online music services is used to demonstrate how the changes in the proposed parameters can affect the costs for online music streaming providers. Managerial implications are also discussed.},

abstract = {Top-N item recommendation techniques, e.g., pairwise models, learn the rank of users' preferred items through separating items into positive samples if user-item interactions exist, and negative samples otherwise. This separation results in an important issue: the extreme imbalance between positive and negative samples, because the number of items with user actions is much less than those without actions. The problem is even worse for "cold-start" users. In addition, existing learning models only consider the observed user-item proximity, while neglecting other useful relations, such as the unobserved but potentially helpful user-item relations, and high-order proximity in user-user, item-item relations. In this paper, we aim at incorporating multiple types of user-item relations into a unified pairwise ranking model towards approximately optimizing ranking metrics mean average precision (MAP), and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Instead of taking statical separation of positive and negative sets, we employ a random walk approach to dynamically draw positive samples from short random walk sequences, and a rank-aware negative sampling method to draw negative samples for efficiently learning the proposed pairwise ranking model. The proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art baselines on two large and sparse datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the other baselines with average 4{\%} at different top-N metrics, in particular for cold-start users with 6{\%} on average.},

abstract = {In recommender systems, collaborative filtering technology is an important method to evaluate user preference through exploiting user feedback data, and has been widely used in industrial areas. Diffusion-based recommendation algorithms inspired by diffusion phenomenon in physical dynamics are a crucial branch of collaborative filtering technology, which use a bipartite network to represent collection behaviors between users and items. However, diffusion-based recommendation algorithms calculate the similarity between users and make recommendations by only considering implicit feedback but neglecting the benefits from explicit feedback data, which would be a significant feature in recommender systems. This paper proposes a mixed similarity diffusion model to integrate both explicit feedback and implicit feedback. First, cosine similarity between users is calculated by explicit feedback, and we integrate it with resource-allocation index calculated by implicit feedback. We further improve the performance of the mixed similarity diffusion model by considering the degrees of users and items at the same time in diffusion processes. Some sophisticated experiments are designed to evaluate our proposed method on three real-world data sets. Experimental results indicate that recommendations given by the mixed similarity diffusion perform better on both the accuracy and the diversity than that of most state-of-the-art algorithms.},

When the predictions of multiple PMF models are linearly combined with the predictions of Restricted Boltzmann Machines models, we achieve an error rate of 0.8861, that is nearly 7{\%} better than the score of Netflix's own system. 1},

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the fea- tures themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learn- ing continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of- the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken to- gether, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state- of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

abstract = {The bipartite graph is a ubiquitous data structure that can model the relationship between two entity types: for instance, users and items, queries and webpages. In this paper, we study the problem of ranking vertices of a bipartite graph, based on the graph's link structure as well as prior information about vertices (which we term a query vector). We present a new solution, BiRank, which iteratively assigns scores to vertices and finally converges to a unique stationary ranking. In contrast to the traditional random walk-based methods, BiRank iterates towards optimizing a regularization function, which smooths the graph under the guidance of the query vector. Importantly, we establish how BiRank relates to the Bayesian methodology, enabling the future extension in a probabilistic way. To show the rationale and extendability of the ranking methodology, we further extend it to rank for the more generic n-partite graphs. BiRank's generic modeling of both the graph structure and vertex features enables it to model various ranking hypotheses flexibly. To illustrate its functionality, we apply the BiRank and TriRank (ranking for tripartite graphs) algorithms to two real-world applications: a general ranking scenario that predicts the future popularity of items, and a personalized ranking scenario that recommends items of interest to users. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate BiRank's soundness (fast convergence), efficiency (linear in the number of graph edges) and effectiveness (achieving state-of-the-art in the two real-world tasks).},

It works with binary ratings (sometimes also called implicit ratings), as it is typically the case in a Web environment. Our method is capable of incorporating new information in parallel with performing recommendation. New sessions and new users are used to update the similarity matrix as they appear. The proposed algorithm is compared with a non-incremental one, as well as with an incremental user-based approach, based on an existing explicit rating recommender. The use of techniques for working with sparse matrices on these algorithms is also evaluated. All versions, implemented in R, are evaluated on 5 datasets with various number of users and/or items. We observed that: Recall tends to improve when we continuously add information to the recommender model; the time spent for recommendation does not degrade; the time for updating the similarity matrix (necessary to the recommendation) is relatively low and motivates the use of the item-based incremental approach. Moreover we study how the number of items and users affects the user based and the item based approaches. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Nowadays, recommender systems provide essential web services on the Internet. There are mainly two categories of traditional recommendation algorithms: Content-Based (CB) and Collaborative Filtering (CF). CF methods make recommendations mainly according to the historical feedback information. They usually perform better when there is sufficient feedback information but less successful on new users and items, which is called the "cold-start" problem. However, CB methods help in this scenario because of using content information. To take both advantages of CF and CB, how to combine them is a challenging issue. To the best of our knowledge, little previous work has been done to solve the problem in one unified recommendation model. In this work, we study how to integrate CF and CB, which utilizes both types of information in model-level but not in result-level and makes recommendations adaptively. A novel attention-based model named Attentional Content{\&}Collaborate Model (ACCM) is proposed. Attention mechanism helps adaptively adjust for each user-item pair from which source information the recommendation is made. Especially, a "cold sampling" learning strategy is designed to handle the cold-start problem. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that the ACCM performs better on both warm and cold tests compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successful approach commonly used by many recommender systems. Conventional CF-based methods use the ratings given to items by users as the sole source of information for learning to make recommendation. However, the ratings are often very sparse in many applications, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. To address this sparsity problem, auxiliary information such as item content information may be utilized. Collaborative topic regression (CTR) is an appealing recent method taking this approach which tightly couples the two components that learn from two different sources of information. Nevertheless, the latent representation learned by CTR may not be very effective when the auxiliary information is very sparse. To address this problem, we generalize recent advances in deep learning from i.i.d. input to non-i.i.d. (CF-based) input and propose in this paper a hierarchical Bayesian model called collaborative deep learning (CDL), which jointly performs deep representation learning for the content information and collaborative filtering for the ratings (feedback) matrix. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets from different domains show that CDL can significantly advance the state of the art.},

abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded immense success on speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. However, the exploration of deep neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation -- collaborative filtering -- on the basis of implicit feedback. Although some recent work has employed deep learning for recommendation, they primarily used it to model auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and acoustic features of musics. When it comes to model the key factor in collaborative filtering -- the interaction between user and item features, they still resorted to matrix factorization and applied an inner product on the latent features of users and items. By replacing the inner product with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary function from data, we present a general framework named NCF, short for Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering. NCF is generic and can express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. To supercharge NCF modelling with non-linearities, we propose to leverage a multi-layer perceptron to learn the user-item interaction function. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show significant improvements of our proposed NCF framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Empirical evidence shows that using deeper layers of neural networks offers better recommendation performance.},

@article{He2017c,
abstract = {This paper contributes improvements on both the effectiveness and efficiency of Matrix Factorization (MF) methods for implicit feedback. We highlight two critical issues of existing works. First, due to the large space of unobserved feedback, most existing works resort to assign a uniform weight to the missing data to reduce computational complexity. However, such a uniform assumption is invalid in real-world settings. Second, most methods are also designed in an offline setting and fail to keep up with the dynamic nature of online data. We address the above two issues in learning MF models from implicit feedback. We first propose to weight the missing data based on item popularity, which is more effective and flexible than the uniform-weight assumption. However, such a non-uniform weighting poses efficiency challenge in learning the model. To address this, we specifically design a new learning algorithm based on the element-wise Alternating Least Squares (eALS) technique, for efficiently optimizing a MF model with variably-weighted missing data. We exploit this efficiency to then seamlessly devise an incremental update strategy that instantly refreshes a MF model given new feedback. Through comprehensive experiments on two public datasets in both offline and online protocols, we show that our eALS method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art implicit MF methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/hexiangnan/sigir16-eals.},

abstract = {Recommender systems provide userswith personalized suggestions for products or services. These systems often rely on Collaborat- ing Filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The two more successful approaches to CF are latent factor models, which di- rectly profile both users and products, and neighborhood models, which analyze similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce some innovations to both approaches. The factor and neighborhood models can now be smoothly merged, thereby build- ing a more accurate combined model. Further accuracy improve- ments are achieved by extending themodels to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. The methods are tested on the Netflix data. Results are better than those previously published on that dataset. In addition, we suggest a newevaluationmetric,which highlights the differences among methods, based on their perfor- mance at a top-K recommendation task. Categories},

abstract = {This work develops a representation learning method for bipartite networks. While existing works have developed various embedding methods for network data, they have primarily focused on homo-geneous networks in general and overlooked the special properties of bipartite networks. As such, these methods can be suboptimal for embedding bipartite networks. In this paper, we propose a new method named BiNE, short for Bipartite Network Embedding, to learn the vertex representations for bipartite networks. By performing biased random walks pur-posefully, we generate vertex sequences that can well preserve the long-tail distribution of vertices in the original bipartite network. We then propose a novel optimization framework by accounting for both the explicit relations (i.e., observed links) and implicit relations (i.e., unobserved but transitive links) in learning the ver-tex representations. We conduct extensive experiments on several real datasets covering the tasks of link prediction (classification), recommendation (personalized ranking), and visualization. Both quantitative results and qualitative analysis verify the effectiveness and rationality of our BiNE method.},
